This portfolio shows a selection of independent projects and initiatives that I have developed and implemented outside of my normal job responsibilities.

Each project started with a real problem, or research into how buildings are made, or the need to try out an idea in a situation that was almost like the real thing before expanding it further. I created these systems on my own, and many of them are now ready to be used by businesses. They can handle real users, transactional data, hardware integrations, and complex operational requirements.

In all of these projects, I was responsible for the technical side of things. This included designing the solutions and the system, as well as implementing it, setting it up, monitoring it, and making improvements over time. The focus was always on reliability, data integrity, performance and maintainability, rather than short-lived prototypes.

Some of these projects later became examples to be followed or plans for larger platforms, internal systems, or long-term business solutions. Others were more technical and showed me new ways of designing systems, making them able to deal with more users, and how to keep systems working well in big business.`})})]}),r?e.jsx("div",{className:"mt-6 space-y-10",children:e.jsx("section",{"aria-label":"Cross-company initiatives",className:"space-y-3",children:e.jsx(l,{projects:s,showDetails:!0})})}):e.jsx("p",{className:"mt-6 text-sm text-gray-600 dark:text-gray-300",children:"Project details will appear here once added to the resume data source."})]})})]})};export{u as ProjectPage};
